# Orb Visualization #

There's data everywhere out there in the world. And as our world becomes more and more interconnected, the more data there is and the more every event affects the rest of the world. We output so much data, but unfortunately they're locked up in reports and spreadsheets and obfuscated behind walls of numbers. We need to be able to actually see what's happening in order to understand it, and therefore Orb.

Orb is a visualization platform dedicated to making globe-spanning datasets accessible and easy to consume. Something that is both easy to use and amazing to look at as well.

Cheers, let's get started!
