/*

Extends all resource classes to have reference counting.

Loads or prefetches all resources through the code. When we are done using an asset
we tag them for release calling the release function within the resource class. This
decrements the ref count.

The resources that have no references can be disposed of based on time or memory
constraints. The developer should not have to worry about the internals of the 
ResourceManager
